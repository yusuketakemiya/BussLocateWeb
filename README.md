# Vue Onsen UI Kitchen Sink

This is a sample app featuring **Onsen UI 2 + Vue**. This version uses **Vuex** to share the state among components.

> A version **without Vuex** is provided in [`no-vuex` branch](https://github.com/onsenui/vue-onsenui-kitchensink/tree/no-vuex).

**Check out the [preview here](https://onsenui.github.io/vue-onsenui-kitchensink/)**.

This project has been created with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and [webpack-simple](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack-simple) template. Webpack configuration has been modified to work with Onsen UI +2.2.0.

## About CSS

Onsen UI bundles `css/onsen-css-components.css` wich can be directly included in an app. However, this example uses the source `css-components-src/src/onsen-css-components.css` where colors can be easily modified. In order to support this, [`postcss-cssnext`](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext) must be used in Webpack.
